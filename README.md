# ContactInfoWebApp
This is a Java-based web application designed to help users securely manage their personal contacts. It allows registered users to create, view, update, and delete contact info through an intuitive web interface. The app was built using Java EE technologies with proper separation of concerns (Servlets, DAO, Entity classes).
